    Examine the following code:
      const birthday = '18.04.1982';
      const age = someCode(birthday);

    Here we have a constant birthday for the date, and also the age constant.
    The age is calculated from birthday using someCode(), which means a function call that we didn’t explain yet (we will soon!), but the details don’t matter here, the point is that age is calculated somehow based on the birthday.
    Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?

      const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make birthday uppercase?
      const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase?
    */
    // birthday는 생년월일로 변하지 않을, 하드코딩한 값이므로 대문자 상수에 적합. 그러나 age는 나이로 런타임 때 평가되는 값이긴 하지만 매해 다른 값이 나올 수 있음. 따라서 대문자 상수로는 부적합.
